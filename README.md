- 👋 Hi, I’m @jakobfrederikson, a third-year software engineering student from New Zealand.
- 💫 Favourite project (so far): [Cloudroom](https://github.com/jakobfrederikson/Cloudroom). This was a 1-2 month long school project that taught me about using python in web development.
- 🌳 I'm currently learning: C# through "The C# Player's Guide" by RB Whitaker.
- 🌱 My current project: a year long school project on rendering grass in Unity 😄
