- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakobfrederikson, a software engineering student from New Zealand.
- ðŸ’« Favourite project: [Cloudroom](https://github.com/jakobfrederikson/Cloudroom). This was a 1-2 month long school project that taught me about using python in web development. Flask is amazing!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on: growing as a programmer through [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)! This is my favourite way to keep my brain ticking so I don't forget how to program ðŸ˜„
